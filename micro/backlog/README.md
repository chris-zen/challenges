## Instructions

Use this README as a contest backlog (please, refactor it if you find it too long) and add any kind of problem that you think that may be interesting to work in. 

If you want to share the solution for a contest, create a sbt project in the contest subfolder with your username so that all the different versions of the code can share the same repository.
